; This is part of my AutoHotkey [1] script that puts my computer to sleep when I
; press Win+F12.

; I chose that keyboard shortcut because it's very similar to the Fn+F12
; keyboard shortcut on my laptop.

; I don't have my PC set to require a password to resume, so I also have a
; second version (Win+Shift+F12) in case I want to lock the PC first.
